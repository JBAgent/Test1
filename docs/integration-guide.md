# Claude Integration with MCP Server for Microsoft Graph API

This guide explains how to integrate Claude with your Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to enable interactions with Microsoft Graph API directly from Claude conversations.

## Setup Requirements

1. **MCP Server**: Your operational MCP server for Microsoft Graph API
2. **Claude API Access**: An Anthropic API key with access to Claude
3. **Node.js Application**: Express.js application to handle the integration

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
# Anthropic API
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

# MCP Server
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://your-mcp-server:3000
MCP_USER_ID=default-user

# Application
PORT=4000
```

## Integration Architecture

The integration follows this flow:

1. User sends a query to the application
2. Application forwards the query to Claude with Graph API functions
3. Claude decides if it needs Microsoft Graph data to answer
4. If yes, Claude calls the appropriate Graph API function
5. The application intercepts the function call and forwards it to the MCP server
6. MCP server authenticates, authorizes, and makes the Graph API request
7. Results are returned to Claude, which formulates a final response
8. The application returns Claude's response to the user

## Capabilities

The integration provides Claude with these Microsoft Graph capabilities:

1. **General Graph Query**: Flexible access to any Graph endpoint
2. **User Management**: Get, create, and update user information
3. **Group Access**: Retrieve group data and membership
4. **Pagination Handling**: Automatic handling of large result sets 

## Use Cases

### 1. Organizational Analytics

Users can ask Claude questions about the organization that require Graph API data:

- "How many users are in our Marketing department?"
- "What's the average team size in our organization?"
- "Who are the managers in the Engineering department?"

Claude will analyze the question, fetch the required data using Graph API, and provide insights.

### 2. User Information Lookup

Claude can retrieve and summarize user information:

- "Tell me about Jane Doe's team and role"
- "Who reports to Michael Smith?"
- "What groups is Sara Johnson a member of?"

### 3. Data Visualization Preparation

Claude can prepare data for visualization by:

- Fetching organization data from Graph API
- Processing and structuring it for visualization 
- Generating visualization code or formatted data

### 4. Automated Workflows

Use Claude to:

- Identify users without specific attributes
- Find groups with configuration issues
- Generate reports on license usage or user activity

## Example Conversation

**User**: "I need to understand our team structure. Can you show me all department managers and their direct reports?"

**Claude**: (Analyzes request and decides to use Graph API)
1. Fetches managers with `getUsers` function filtering by jobTitle
2. For each manager, gets direct reports using Graph API relationship
3. Organizes and presents the information in a structured format

## Security Considerations

1. **Permission Boundaries**: The MCP server enforces permissions, so Claude can only access data allowed by the user's context
2. **Minimal Data Exposure**: Configure Claude to request only necessary data
3. **Logging**: Implement logging of all Graph API requests for audit purposes
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting to prevent excessive API usage

## Extending the Integration

You can extend the integration by:

1. **Adding More Graph API Functions**: Create specialized functions for Teams, SharePoint, etc.
2. **Implementing Caching**: Cache common queries to improve performance
3. **Building UI Components**: Create a web interface for the Claude-MCP integration
4. **Adding Analytics**: Track common user queries and Graph API usage

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Authentication Errors**: Verify MCP server credentials and token expiration
2. **Permission Issues**: Check user context permissions in MCP
3. **Rate Limiting**: Microsoft Graph API has rate limits, implement backoff strategies
4. **Data Format Issues**: Ensure Claude can properly parse Graph API responses

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the integration application
2. Test with common organizational queries
3. Gather user feedback
4. Iterate on the function definitions to improve Claude's capabilities
